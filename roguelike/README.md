This directory is where i am working on a top down "roguelike" (its actually a dungeon crawler but i mixed up genre names, but i'll fix that alater.)
The goal of this is to have a working, playable game when this is complete. As for when this is complete, that will come around later.

Currently there are 3 versions of the game:
-oldRogue: the first version, it barely works and i'll probably remove it at some point.
-newRogue: the WIP version that shall overhaul how parts of the game work, its unfinished, and missing some of the features that the current working version has.
-the files that aren't in a subdirectory of roguelike is the currently working version, it isn't currently being worked on and shall be replaced with newRogue when it is done.

Current features that will be added to newRogue:
- port features from the current version to the experimental/newRogue.
- get the vision circle working without breaking consumables. (This is the main reason for the overhual)
