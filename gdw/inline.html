	<h1>Inline Elements</h1>
	<section>This is a section element, doesn't appear to do much.</section>
	<p>Inline elements are used to markup text inside a block element like a paragraph or division. Each element does different things to the text. <strong>This text is in a strong element.</strong> <b>Bold</b> and <strong>strong</strong> seem to have the same effect. <em> This is emphasised text.</em> It seems to look the same as <i> Italicized text.</i></p>
<p>Putting text inside quote elements, <q>like this quoted text here</q>, makes the text display with quotation marks around it. Code tags are meant to look like source code. <code> this is the example.</code> The keyboard element looks similar, <kbd> There's an example of keyboard text.</kbd></p>
<p>Superscript looks like <sup>this</sup>. and subscript looks like <sub>this</sub>.</p>
<p><span>span elements don't do anything, at least by themselves. This entire paragraph is inside a span element</span></p>
